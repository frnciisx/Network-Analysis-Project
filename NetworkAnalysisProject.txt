Overview:

Applied my skills from training projects to complete a hands-on network analysis project using Ubuntu, Wireshark, and tcpdump. This project strengthened my understanding of Linux environments, network protocols, and packet-level traffic analysis.

Steps & Process:

Set up an Ubuntu virtual machine and became familiar with the Linux terminal and system navigation.
Installed and configured Wireshark and tcpdump to capture network traffic in a controlled environment.
Captured approximately 30,000 packets, analyzing traffic to and from the VMâ€™s IP address.
Monitored traffic for commonly used websites including:

testudo.umd.edu
youtube.com
maps.umd.edu
linkedin.com

Applied Wireshark display filters to isolate specific traffic types, including HTTP and DNS.
Investigated unsecured connections by filtering for http traffic, identifying unexpected sources such as http://connectivity-check.ubuntu.com.
Followed HTTP streams to analyze communication between client and server and verified website legitimacy.
Explored TCP/IP communication, including TCP port analysis (tcp.port==80) and encryption considerations for HTTPS traffic.
Documented observations and insights, improving understanding of network behavior, security implications, and packet-level troubleshooting.


Key Learnings & Skills Gained:
Practical experience in capturing and analyzing large volumes of network packets.


Hands-on understanding of network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS) and packet structure.


Skills in network security analysis, including detecting unsecured connections and understanding encrypted traffic limitations.


Developed the ability to use Wireshark and tcpdump to monitor and troubleshoot network activity in a Linux environment.
