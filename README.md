## Network Analysis Project

**Overview:**  
Applied my skills from training projects to complete a hands-on network analysis project using Ubuntu, Wireshark, and tcpdump. This project strengthened my understanding of Linux environments, network protocols, and packet-level traffic analysis.

**Tools & Environment:**  
- Ubuntu VM
- Wireshark
- tcpdump
- Linux Terminal

**Process:**  
1. Captured ~30,000 packets from websites like testudo.umd.edu, youtube.com, and linkedin.com.  
2. Filtered HTTP and DNS traffic using Wireshark display filters.  
3. Followed HTTP streams to understand traffic flow and verify website legitimacy.

**Key Learnings:**  
- Understanding of TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS protocols  
- Packet analysis and security monitoring  
- Linux terminal navigation and network troubleshooting
